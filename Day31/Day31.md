# Functionality
- A random french word  from a csv file will appear on on screen for 3 secs
- After 3 secs, the card will flip to it's english translation
- If you know the french word before it gets translated press the green button
- If you don't know the word before it gets translated press the red button.
- Known words will be removed from the csv file so next time you start the Flash Card App it doesn't appear on the deck.
